- position elements
- make circles size dependant on screen size
- make sure brightness of circles is sufficient (sum of colors must not be lower than XXX)
- experiment with expanding animation
- text should fade in after (during?) expansion
- back button? (a black pulsing circle inwards?)
- mobile friendliness
