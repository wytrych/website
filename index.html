    <h1>Hi Spotify!</h1>

    <h2>I would love to work with you!</h2>

    <h3> Why?</h3>

    <p>I believe that you are the future of the music industry and I would like to be part of that feature. You also have amazing developers that would allow me to reach the next level.</p>

    <h3> Why me? </h3>

    <p>I learn really fast and I love being challenged. When I care for something I can work fast and give all the best I have. And apart from that, I am a musician and a sound engineer, so I know things about DSP, waves theory, acoustics, psychoacoustics. Math is also something I've always enjoyed and know some advanced math topics, like logarithms and calculus. I also feel strong about solving computer science problems with graphs and dynamic programming. And I am assionate about TDD and Clean Code.</p>

    <h3>What's with the background?</h3>

    <p>The background is interactive! You can click on it to generate more pulsing circles. You can also go to a <a id="show-background-link" href="">textless version</a> with sound</p>
	</main>

    <p id="empty-state-text">Turn up your speakers and click or tap on the background to create a sound wave.</p>
